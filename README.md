# Solar System Simulation

Simulation of the interaction between the solar system planets made in C++. The orbits are assumed to be circular in the same plane. The distance between each planet is not proportional for visibility but revolution speeds are.

## To execute

* Compile the program with:
```
make
```

* Then execute with:
```
./app
```
